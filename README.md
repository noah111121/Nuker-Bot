### Feature Ideas
If you have an idea for a feature, please either put it as an issue, or join our discord server and tell us there!

### Want no fuss and just to quickly nuke a server?
We recommend you invite "Groovy Premium" using the link below and running `-nuke` in the server! Done!

### Groovy Premium
Don't want to host one yourself? We host one disguised as "Groovy Premium".  
Invite Link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=818853884495003689&permissions=8&scope=bot  
It will be online almost 24/7, however we cannot guarantee it, therefore we still recommend hosting one yourself...
